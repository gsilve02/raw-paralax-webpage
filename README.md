# Updated Website 
*by Genevieve Silverman*

Welcome to the files that compose my updated website. Much of the content is
similar to what was listed on my original website, which I built for my
web programming class.

This updated website uses new features such as parallax scrolling 
 I built this for fun when I got home on
the first day of spring break 2017! I hope you enjoy.
